# Debt-Optimizer

# Description
An app that allows user to create an account (authenticated with Passport) and enter loans or other forms of debt. An algorithm then calculates whether the snowball (paying off lowest principal debts first) or avalanche (paying off highest interest rate debt first) method pays off the debts quicker. The most efficient method is displayed along with the time needed to repay all debt. Users can continue to create, edit, and delete loans as needed.
